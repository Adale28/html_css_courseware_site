        <h2>Welcome to the Course Creation Tool</h2>
        <p>These tools helped me to create and manage my course content effectively.</p>
        <h3>Creation Tools Used</h3>
        <ul>
            <li>W3school - web devolpment instruction and example tool</li>
            <li>VS Code - Editor to construct codes and testing</li>
            <li>Github for launching</li>
        </ul>
        <p>I wanted the expereince in creating my courseware by creating my own tool, as a web developer I have now
            found a niche and I thank you MR Whyte for this oppurtunity</p>

        <h3>Media Elements &amp; Webtools – Why They Were Chosen</h3>
        <h4>1. Text Content</h4>
        <p>Why chosen: Text explanations allow you to introduce and scaffold concepts clearly, following a logical flow.
        </p>

        <p>Supports: All learners, especially those who benefit from reading/writing, and supports basic knowledge
            acquisition.</p>

        <p>How used: Learning objectives, code explanations, instructions, and summaries.</p>

        <h4>2. Images &amp; Diagrams</h4>
        <p>Why chosen: Visuals (e.g., tag maps, code structure charts) simplify abstract code concepts like nesting or
            syntax.</p>

        <p>Supports: Visual/spatial learners and enhances memory retention.</p>

        <p>How used: HTML structure image, before/after style comparisons.</p>

        <h4>3. Embedded Video (YouTube)</h4>
        <p>Why chosen: Students engage more when seeing code in action. Videos offer real-time examples and professional
            modeling.</p>

        <p>Supports: Auditory + visual learners; boosts understanding of complex steps.</p>

        <p>How used: HTML &amp; CSS crash courses embedded in lesson pages.</p>

        <h4>4. JSFiddle (Webtool 1)</h4>
        <p>Why chosen: JSFiddle lets students write and preview code instantly without downloading software.</p>

        <p>Supports: Psychomotor skill development (writing &amp; applying HTML/CSS), real-world coding practice.</p>

        <p>How used: Students complete hands-on tasks and share links for feedback and assessment.</p>

        <h4>5. H5P Activities (Webtool 2)</h4>
        <p>Why chosen: Interactive H5P quizzes and drag-and-drops make learning more active and memorable.</p>

        <p>Supports: Cognitive reinforcement through practice; great for formative assessment.</p>

        <p>How used: Matching tags, fill-in-the-blanks for CSS properties.</p>

        <h4>6. Padlet (Webtool 3)</h4>
        <p>Why chosen: Padlet supports reflection, collaboration, and sharing of student-created content (e.g., JSFiddle
            links).</p>

        <p>Supports: Affective domain (self-expression, feedback), peer learning.</p>

        <p>How used: Students post their web pages and reflect on their learning.</p>

        <h4>7. Downloadable Cheat Sheets &amp; Instructions</h4>
        <p>Why chosen: Supports review, offline learning, and differentiated instruction.</p>

        <p> Supports: Learners who need print-based, slower-paced, or offline options.</p>

        <p>How used: Word documents (cheat sheet, student task guide) linked from the site.</p>
